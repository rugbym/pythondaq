# pythondaq
Repository in which a school project for experiment automating is made. Learned a lot about making a controller, model and view and the interaction between them.
In my views UIs are made with either Click or PyQt5.
## GUI
In pythondaq/src/view there are several files. The file "eindopdracht.py" is the GUI made for an experiment to measure the current and voltage of a solarcell using an Arduino Device. PyQt5 in Visual Studio code was used for making the GUI and Poetry to run the file/app.
## CLI
Another file in pythondaq/src/view is diode.py. This is a CLI for an experiment where the current and voltage across a LED had to be measured using an Arduino Device. Click was used for making the CLI and Poetry to call the file as a command.
